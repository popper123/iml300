[Room Tour / Finding My Kitty](http://popper123.github.io/iml300/project-1) is an interactive web experience about me move to a new house 


### Description

Move to a new environment, always have experience that cannot find my belongings, no matter how hard I find it. Interesting thing is it always shows up when you are not trying that hard.
Try to move this experience on to the web, and invite online friends to my digital room tour.
For myself it's also a chance to document the room where I lived for several months. Will become another good experience when I look back.
